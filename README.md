# Calendar Journal

A recreation of a college-era fun project: a desktop calendar where clicking a day
opens a notepad-style editor to write and save a journal entry. Entries live in a
local SQLite database — no cloud, no accounts, your journal stays on your machine.

The original was written in **Java Swing**; that first version is preserved on the
`childhood` branch. This branch is the **JavaFX rewrite** that grows it into a
polished, shippable product (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).

## Features

- Month calendar with previous/next navigation; today is highlighted.
- Click a day to open the editor; write, **Save**, or **Delete**.
- Days with an entry are marked with a green dot.
- One entry per day, stored in SQLite.
- Full-text search index over entries (schema-level; UI coming per the roadmap).
- Data kept in a stable per-user location that survives reinstalls.

## Tech stack

- **Java 21**, **JavaFX 21** (UI), **SQLite** via `sqlite-jdbc` (storage)
- **Maven** build; **JUnit 5** tests
- Native installers via **jpackage**

## Run

From source (recommended for development):

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

> The first run downloads the JavaFX plugin's dependencies (one-time), then opens
> the window and blocks until you close it.

Or build and run the packaged jar (what the installed app runs):

```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/calendar-journal.jar
```

## Test

```bash
mvn test
```

## Build a desktop installer

Each installer bundles its own Java + JavaFX runtime. `jpackage` only builds for
the OS it runs on, so build each on its native platform:

```bash
./build-deb.sh          # Linux  → packaging/dist/*.deb   (needs fakeroot)
./build-mac.sh          # macOS  → packaging/dist/*.dmg
.\build-windows.ps1     # Windows → packaging/dist/*.msi  (needs the WiX Toolset)
```

Install the Debian package and launch **Calendar Journal** from your app menu:

```bash
sudo apt install ./packaging/dist/calendar-journal_1.0.0_amd64.deb
# uninstall: sudo apt remove calendar-journal
```

### Releases

Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the `.deb`,
`.msi`, and `.dmg` on Linux/Windows/macOS runners and attaches them to the
GitHub Release automatically.

## Where your data lives

The journal database is stored in a per-user data directory (created on first run):

| OS | Location |
|----|----------|
| Linux | `~/.local/share/CalendarJournal/journal.db` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/CalendarJournal`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/CalendarJournal/journal.db` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\CalendarJournal\journal.db` |

A legacy `~/journal.db` from the earliest version is migrated automatically on first run.

## Project layout

```
src/main/java/com/journal/
  Launcher.java            # plain main() entry point (fat-jar / jpackage friendly)
  JournalApp.java          # JavaFX Application — wires DAO to the UI
  CalendarView.java        # month grid: navigation, entry dots, today highlight
  JournalEditorDialog.java # the editor: text area + Save / Delete / Cancel
  JournalDao.java          # all SQLite access; versioned schema + migrations + FTS
  AppPaths.java            # resolves the per-user data directory
src/test/java/com/journal/
  JournalDaoTest.java      # schema, migration, and search tests
build-deb.sh               # builds the .deb via jpackage
ROADMAP.md                 # product roadmap (v1.0 → v2.0)
```

## Roadmap

This is an evolving personal product. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the planned
releases — writing experience, search & organization, data safety, and reminders.
