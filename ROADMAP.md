# Calendar Journal — Product Roadmap

A polished personal journaling app: a calendar where clicking a day opens an editor
to write and save an entry. Local-first, no cloud — your journal stays on your machine.

**Direction**
- **Audience:** a genuinely nice daily-driver journaling app for personal use.
- **Platform:** Java desktop, shipped as native installers (Linux/Windows/macOS) via `jpackage`.
- **UI stack:** JavaFX (CSS theming, `WebView` Markdown preview, built-in charts).
- **No** cloud, accounts, sync, mobile/web, or AI — by design.

## Today — v0.1 (shipped)

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Month calendar with prev/next navigation, today highlighted | ✅ |
| One plain-text entry per day; Save / Delete | ✅ |
| SQLite storage (`entries` table) | ✅ |
| Green dot on days that have an entry | ✅ |
| Native `.deb` installer with bundled runtime | ✅ |

---

## Foundations (built first in v1.0)

These unlock most of the roadmap:

- **JavaFX migration** ✅ — Swing UI ported to JavaFX (`JournalApp`, `CalendarView`,
  `JournalEditorDialog`), reusing `JournalDao` unchanged. `org.openjfx` deps shaded into
  the fat jar via a non-Application `Launcher`; `.deb` repackaged with the JavaFX runtime.
  CSS theming + Light/Dark toggle ✅ (external `app.css`/`dark.css`, theme in Preferences,
  applied to all windows). `WebView` Markdown / charts still to come in later v1.0 steps.
- **DB schema v2 + migrations** ✅ — versioned schema (`schema_version` + ordered steps).
  New shape: `entries(id, entry_date, title, content, mood, created_at, updated_at)`,
  `tags`, `entry_tags`, and an FTS5 `entries_fts` table (trigger-synced) for search.
  `init()` creates v2 fresh or migrates v1 in place; legacy rows preserved. Covered by
  JUnit tests (`JournalDaoTest`, 9 tests). The one-entry-per-day API is unchanged.
- **Settings store + Preferences screen** ✅ — `SettingsDao` (`settings(key, value)`,
  typed get/set, tested) with a `Settings` facade. `PreferencesDialog` (File → Preferences…)
  edits editor font size and week-start; both persist and apply live (editor font, calendar
  layout). Menu bar added to the main window.
- **Stable app data directory** ✅ — `AppPaths` stores `journal.db` under
  `~/.local/share/CalendarJournal/` (platform-appropriate) and migrates the legacy
  `~/journal.db` on first run, so data survives reinstalls.
- **Packaging update** — `jpackage` bundles JavaFX modules via `jlink`; generalize `build-deb.sh`.
